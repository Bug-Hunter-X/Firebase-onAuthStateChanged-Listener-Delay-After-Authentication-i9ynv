# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Delay

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener: a delay in triggering after successful authentication. This can lead to errors when your application tries to access user data before the listener has updated the user state.

## Problem

The `onAuthStateChanged` listener doesn't always update instantly, particularly with fast authentication flows. This can result in null pointer exceptions or the display of outdated user information. 

## Solution

The provided solution shows how to handle this delay using a Promise-based approach. This ensures that user data is only accessed after the listener successfully updates the authentication state, thus preventing errors.
