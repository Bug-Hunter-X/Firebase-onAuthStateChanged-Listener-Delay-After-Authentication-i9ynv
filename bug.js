The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger immediately after a successful authentication, leading to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on immediate user state updates.  This is especially noticeable when authentication happens quickly, for instance, using a federated provider like Google Sign-In. The application might attempt to access user data before the listener has had time to update the user object, causing null pointer exceptions or incorrect data display.
